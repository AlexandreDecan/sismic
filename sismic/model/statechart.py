        Copy (a part of) given *statechart* into current one.

        Copy *source* state, all its descendants and all involved transitions from *statechart*
        into current statechart. The *source* state will override *replace* state (but will be
        renamed to *replace*), and all its descendants in *statechart* will be copied into current
        statechart.

        All the transitions that are involved in the process must be fully contained in *source*
        state (ie. for all transition T: S->T, if S (resp. T) is a descendant-or-self of *source*,
        then T (resp. S) must be a descendant-or-self of *source*).

        If necessary, callable *renaming_func* can be provided. This function should accept a
        (state) name and return a (new state) name. Use *renaming_func* to avoid conflicting
        names in target statechart.

        :param statechart: Source statechart from which states will be copied.
        :param source: Name of the source state.
        :param replace: Name of the target state. Should refer to a StateMixin with no child.
        :param renaming_func: Optional callable to resolve conflicting names.
