statechart:
  name: Shallow history
  description: |
    A statechart that makes use of an history state.
    It represents a process that loops over three states (s1, s2, s3) on `next` event.
    The process can be interrupted with a `pause` event.
    When paused, the process can either be continued (`continue` event) or stopped (`stop` event).
  root state:
    name: root
    initial: loop
    states:
    - name: loop
      initial: s1
      transitions:
        - target: pause
          event: pause
      states:
        - name: s1
          transitions:
            - target: s2
              event: next
        - name: s2
          transitions:
            - target: s3
              event: next
        - name: s3
          transitions:
            - target: s1
